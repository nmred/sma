# 致谢

I am deeply indebted to my colleagues at IDRIS supercomputing center—in particular, to Denis Girou, Pierre-François Lavallée, and Philippe Collinet—for more than 20 years of sharing vision and insights in high-performance computing.
I have also benefited from the stimulating environment of Maison de la Simulation, and I am indebted to Edouard Audit for his warm support and Pierre Kestener for a critical reading of some of the book chapters.
I am also grateful to Arch Robison from Intel Corporation, for exchanges that sharpened my understanding of TBB.
