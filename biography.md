Victor Alessandrini After obtaining a PhD in Theoretical Physics in Argentina—where he was born— he spent several years as a visiting scientist, working in theoretical particle physics in different research laboratories in the United States and Europe, in particular, at the Centre Européen des Recherches Nucleaires (CERN) theory division. In 1978, he was appointed full professor at the University of Paris XI in Orsay, France. His basic interests shifted to computational sciences in the early 1990s, when he was the Founding Director of IDRIS supercomputing center in Orsay, which he directed until 2009. In 2004-2009, he coordinated the DEISA European supercomputing infrastructure, a consortium of national supercomputing centers that pioneered the deployment of high-performance computing services on continental scale. He is currently emeritus Research Director at “Maison de la Simulation,” a CEA-CNRS-INRIA-University research laboratory providing high-level support to HPC. In 2011, he was named “Chevalier de l’Ordre National du Mérite” by the French Republic.
