# 前言

This book <f>proposes</f> a <f>pedagogical</f> introduction to shared memory application programming. It grew out of several years of user training at IDRIS supercomputing center in France, and, more recently, at the PATC training program of the PRACE European infrastructure. It is designed to guide readers with a <f>reasonable</f> background in C-C++ programming, in becoming <f>acquainted</f> with current multicore programming environments, and in developing useful <f>insights</f> about threads. This book is therefore placed at an intermediate level; basic experience in multithreaded programming is of course welcomed, but not mandatory.

本书主要是介绍内存共享应用程序开发。该书最初是法国超级计算机中心的培训教材，最近几年在欧盟基础设施程序开发程序培训中使用，该书的目的是引导读者基于 C/C++ 熟悉当前多核环境应用开发, 深刻理解线程开发，该书的定位是中级教材，主要介绍多线程编程的相关经验

Multithreaded programming is today a core technology, at the basis of any software development project in any branch of applied computer science. There are, naturally, a number of excellent presentations of the subject. We tried to provide in this book a basic overview of the multithreading landscape, so that readers can start mastering threads, benefiting from the abundant references that push these subjects much further in several directions. It seems therefore appropriate to expose in some detail the pedagogical motivations and strategies adopted here.

多线程编程在今天是任何软件开发项目在任何计算机科学分支中的核心技术. 自然的，有一批优秀的资料介绍多线程编程, 这本书试图介绍多线程相关的基础，目的是让读者掌握多线程开发。从多个方向来阐述，因此试图暴露一些教学细节和策略在这里；

## 教学目标

Software engineering practices have experienced a profound evolution in the last 25 years, since shared memory programming first showed up. From simple, monolithic applications designed to solve a specific problem, dealing with a simple parallel context, we moved toward software packages dealing with complex, multicomponent modules, sometimes running in distributed computational environments. Another major evolution in software engineering occurred in the mid-2000s when working processor frequencies—and the peak performance that comes with it—ceased to double every 18 months, because a power dissipation wall was hit. Today, the only way to increase performance is to increase the number of processors, and for this reason multithreading, which was initially a question of choice and opportunity, has become a mandatory software technology. Threads are definitely a part of the life of any software developer concerned with issues of efficient network connectivity and I/O, interoperability, computational performance and scalability, or efficient interactive access to an application.


自从共享内存程序开发首次提出，25年中软件工程实践经历了巨大的演变. 从简单的在庞大的系统中设计是为了解决特定的问题、简单的并行处理到软件打包复杂、多组件模块有时还运行在分布式计算环境中。 软件工程另一个演变是在 2000年左右处理器的频率和性能停止了每18个月翻翻的节奏由于功耗的瓶颈。目前唯一提升性能的途径就是增加处理器个数，这也是多线程开发的原因，使得多线程开发变成了一个必须的技术。线程是每个开发人员所关注问题的一部分，在网络连接、I/O、互操作性、计算性能、可扩展性、有效的交互式数据方面对于一个应用程序。

In this diversified and rapidly evolving landscape, a rather broad view of the utilities and the strategic options proposed by the different multithreading libraries and environments seems to be an important asset for software developers. An overview of different libraries and programming environments operating on Unix-Linux or Windows platforms is proposed, underlining their often complementary capabilities, as well as the fact that there is sometimes benefit in taking advantage of their interoperability. The first chapters of this book develop an overview of the native multithreading libraries like Pthreads (for Unix-Linux systems) or Windows threads, as well as the recent C++11 threads standard, with the purpose of grasping the fundamental issues on thread management and synchronization discussed in the following chapters. A quick introduction to the most basic OpenMP thread management interfaces is also introduced at this stage. In the second part of the book, a detailed discussion of the two high-level, standard programming environments—OpenMP and Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB)—is given.

在多元化快速发展的情况下，一个相对广泛的工具库和 通过不同的多线程库和环境 对于开发人员重要的一部分， 介绍不同开发环境和线程库的操作在 Unix - Linux 或者 Windows 平台下, 强调他们的兼容性，利于程序的移植，本书的第一章介绍本地多线程库，例如 Pthreads （Linux Unix 环境下）或者 Windows 下的 threads, 以及C++11 的标准线程库为了掌握后面几章中介绍的线程管理和同步的基础问题。快速介绍了 OpenMP 线程管理接口。本书第二部分详细讨论高级的线程库分别是 OpenMP 环境和 Intel 的 TBB

OpenMP—which played a fundamental role in disseminating shared memory programming—is today a broadly adopted and well-established standard. Nevertheless, we believe that a more general presentation of the basic concepts of shared memory programming, showing the way they are declined in the various programming environments, is useful for learning to think creatively about threads, not about programming languages. True enough, OpenMP can cope with practically any parallel context in an application. But the implementations of the basic multithreading concepts by different libraries often incorporate additional features that enable, in some specific cases, a better match to the application requirements. Some libraries propose specific extended utilities. A few cases will be given in which C++11 or TBB utilities are profitably used to boost application performance. This does not mean, however, that software developers need to abandon their well-rooted habits and best practices, because most of the time different libraries coexist peacefully and inter-operate inside an application. Examples are proposed of utilities developed using native or basic libraries, but exploited, for example, in an OpenMP environment.

OpenMP 扮演一个基础设施的角色在共享内存编程中, 目前广泛采用并建立了标准. 尽管如此，更加通用的介绍内存共享编程的基础概念的方式是不局限于某个编程语言，更多的学习线程方面的知识而不是具体的某个编程语言。足够真实，OpenMP 可以应用于任何的并行处理的应用程序，但是不同线程库拥有的附加的不同的特性，在指定的应用场景有更好的选择。一些线程库扩展了指定的工具库。个别情况在 C++11 或 TBB 中的工具库为了提升程序的性能。这并不意味着开发人员需要放弃一些良好的特性，因为在一个应用程序中大多时候是允许多种线程库并存并且相互调用的。例如，一些本地或基础库在 OpenMP 中也用到了

This book focuses on parallel and concurrent patterns and issues that commonly occur in real applications, by discussing useful programming idioms, potential pitfalls, and preferred best practices that are very often independent of the underlying programming environment. In any subject, however, complex, there is always a limited number of important concepts and ideas to be solidly grasped. Once they are mastered, the rest is information that can be easily integrated when needed. Being able to think creatively about threads is more important than knowing every possible detail about specific libraries. In training users, our purpose has always been to enhance their insights on threads and to broaden their understanding of the strategic design choices open to them. For this purpose, a substantial number of examples are proposed in each chapter, with commented sources. All, without exception, are applications of varying degrees of complexity that can be compiled, run, and modified if needed. Many examples involve input parameters that can be changed to better understand the code behavior. A special effort has been made to propose simple but realistic examples, dealing with common issues in application programming.

本书侧重于并行和并发处理模式和在正式的应用程序中的并发问题，讨论有用的编程习惯、潜在的缺陷和最佳做法通过一个底层独立的编程环境。 然而在任何一个复杂的内容中都有几个重点的概念和思想需要重点掌握。一旦掌握了，其余的知识很容易的联系起来在需要的时候，可以创造性的理解线程相关概念比知道特定的一个线程的技术实现细节更加重要。对于培训用户我们一直致力于提升对线程的理解，理解其设计思想。出于上述考虑在每章节中有大量的例子和源代码注释。所有的例子都不同程度的复杂并且可以编译、运行并且可以修改如果需要的话。许多例子都涉及可以修改输入参数以更好的理解。尽可能的使例子简单并且可以解决真实的应用开发中遇到的问题。

## 开发环境

This book is addressed to C-C++ programmers. Deep expertise in C++ is not required. True enough, a major step today is the increasing availability of a standard C++11 thread library, but we tried to avoid excluding C programmers. Two of the programming environments discussed here (C++11 and TBB) are C++ libraries, but most of the examples and applications only rely on the usage of C++ objects, an issue easily handled by C programmers. Some more advanced C++ features used by TBB or C++11—like function objects and lambda expressions—are discussed in <f>annex</f> B.

这本书面向C/C++ 程序员的，不需要精通C++, 在今天 C++ 标准线程库日益普及，但是我们试图顾及C程序员。讨论的两个开发环境(C++11 和 TBB) 都是C++ 实现的，但是大部分例子和应用程序仅仅依赖于 C++ 对象，对于C程序员来说很容易处理。一些C++ 高级特性在 TBB 和 C++11 中使用，如函数对象和 lambda 表达式在附录B 中讨论

The role, scope, and potential <f>usefulness</f> of the different programming environments discussed in this book will be clarified as we go, but it is useful to take a first look at their <f>relevance</f>. We will <f>henceforth</f> call native libraries the multithreaded support provided by different operating systems: the Pthreads (Posix Threads) library for Unix-Linux systems and the Windows API (formerly called Win32 API) for Windows. These native libraries provide the primitives needed to construct multithreaded applications, as well as a number of useful utilities.

这本书将清晰的说明不同开发环境中的潜在作用以及他们之间的联系，我们今后将调用原生多线程库在不同的操作系统环境：Pthreads(Unix / Linux 系统) 和 Windows API . 这些原生 LIB 库提供了构建多线程应用的原语，还有一些有用的工具集

The C++11 standard has incorporated a complete set of multithreading facilities into the C++ Standard Library. This evolution was <f>motivated</f> by the obvious interest in <f>boosting</f> C++ to a thread aware programming language, to provide C++ programmers with the <f>capability</f> of <f>disposing</f> of a <f>portable</f> and efficient environment for <f>refined</f> code development. Performance was a basic requirement: the C++11 thread library is designed to support <f>sophisticated</f> system programming without the help of the more basic native programming interfaces. It provides the same basic services as the native libraries <f>mentioned</f> before, as well as a few other refinements and extensions aiming at facilitating code optimization. Given the increasing availability of fully C++11 <f>compliant</f> compilers—like GNU 4.8 or higher in Linux, and Visual Studio 2013 in Windows—we have incorporated C++11 threads in this book on the same footing as Pthreads or Windows threads.

C++11 标准已经将多线程开发库纳入了 C++ 标准库 STL 中了，这次演进对 C++ 在线程开发方面有积极的推动作用， 对于开发精炼的程序提供了轻量级、高效的处理能力的环境. 性能是最基本的要求： C++11 线程库支持复制的系统编程不需要更多的基础原生编程接口。除了提供了和以前提到的原生 Lib 库一样的基础功能，还有一些精炼的可扩展的功能，旨在促进代码优化。鉴于 C++11完全兼容的编译器如 GNU 4.8 或者更高在 Linux 系统中，和 Visual Studio 2013 可用性日益提高，我们在本书中也将C++11 线程库和 Pthreads 、Windows 线程库一样会介绍

Boost is a prestigious, portable, general-purpose C++ library providing powerful utilities in all areas of C++ software development. It includes a multithreading library fully compliant with the C++11 standard. In fact, Boost was the testing ground where the C++11 standard was developed. We will <f>occasionally</f> refer to some specific facilities proposed by Boost.

Boost 是一个知名可移植通用的 C++ 库，提供了功能强大工具库覆盖了整个 C++ 软件开发。多线程库完全兼容 C++11 标准。事实上 Boost 是 C++11 标准制定的实验地。我们将偶尔会引用一些 Boost 相关的类库。

OpenMP and TBB are programming environments proposing high-level programming interfaces encapsulating the native libraries services or the very low-level operating system support for multi- threading, adding value and features. These environments are portable in the sense discussed above: the same programming interfaces with different implementations in different operating systems. The fundamental added value with respect to native libraries is the availability of high-level interfaces for thread management, synchronization, and scheduling, simplifying the programming and deployment of parallel applications. It would not be appropriate, however, to completely disregard the basic libraries on the basis that they are low-level environments. True enough, it takes a <f>substantial</f> amount of time and effort to implement a complex application with only the basic libraries. But they have indeed many features that are <f>definitely</f> not low level, easily accessible to application programmers. And, on the other hand, there are programming contexts that require subtle low-level programming even in a high-level environment like OpenMP, simply because the high-level tools required to <f>cope</f> with them are not proposed by the environment. This is the reason why we believe it is useful and <f>instructive</f> to keep a <f>critical</f> eye on the basic multithreading libraries.

OpenMP 和 TBB 是支持多线程由封装底层操作系统或者原生 Lib 而成的高级编程接口开发环境，并且附加了一些特性。这些开发环境是轻量级的在某种意义上：相同的编程接口在不同操作系统中的不同实现。基于原生库还有附加一些可用的特性如线程管理、线程同步、调度，简化开发和部署并行应用程序。完全不管底层开发接口及环境也不行，确实可以通过底层基础库耗费大量时间实现一个复杂的应用程序，但是有许多特性底层开发接口不支持，比如易于访问对于程序员来说。 另一角度，程序开发背景也需要底层开发相关背景，而不仅仅是使用高级开发接口类似于 OpenMP, 简单的原因是高级接口工具不可能完全应付需求。这就是为什么我们应该使用并且保持批判的眼光来看待多线程库

There are other useful and efficient programming environments that are not discussed in this book, for portability reasons. OpenMP requires compiler support, but it is automatically integrated in any C-C++ compiler. TBB, instead, is a portable library not requiring compiler support. These environments are therefore fully portable. Another very attractive environment is Intel CilkPlus [1], with easy-to- use C-C++ programming interfaces, based on software technologies also adopted by TBB. CilkPlus, however, requires compiler support, traditionally provided by the Intel C-C++ compiler, which limits its portability. But the expected support in the GNU compiler may change the situation in the future. Last but not least, Microsoft has traditionally provided very strong multithreaded support for Windows, today implemented in a set of Concurrency Runtime tools, incorporating, among other things, the Microsoft Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) [2]. A close collaboration between Microsoft and Intel has established a large amount of compatibility between PPL and TBB.

还有一些高效可用的开发环境在这本书没有介绍，由于可移植性的原因。OpenMP 需要编译器的支持，但是任何 C/C++ 编译器可以自动集成。可以用TBB替代，TBB 是一个不需要编译器支持的可移植 Lib 库，因此这些环境都是完全可移植的。还有一个非常有吸引力的环境是 Intel 的 CilkPlus, 但是需要编译器的支持, 需要 Intel 的 C/C++ 编译器支持，降低了可移植性。GNU 编译器将在未来可能会支持。微软在 Windows 系统上提供了强大的多线程支持，实现了一组并行运行工具，接口微软的 Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) 。微软和 Intel 建立了紧密的合作在 PPL 和 TBB 之间大量都是兼容的。

Besides the basic libraries and high-level programming environments mentioned above, this book relies on another relatively small, high-level library we developed during the last few years, called vath. This library proposes some high-level, easy-to-use utilities in the form of C++ classes that encapsulate the low-level primitives provided by the basic libraries. Our initial motivation was to simplify the usage of the thread management utilities proposed by the native and basic libraries and to dispose of simple tools to cope with specific parallel contexts not easily handled in OpenMP. The specific added value that this additional library may provide will be discussed in later chapters. The point we want to make here is that it is as portable as OpenMP or TBB: the same programming interfaces are implemented in Pthreads (for Unix-Linux systems) and in Windows threads. And there is also a third implementation using the C++11 thread library. This book focuses on the use of this library, not on its implementation. However, for pedagogical reasons, a maximal simplicity programming style has been adopted in the source codes, in order to make it easily accessible to readers interested in taking a closer look at basic Pthreads, Windows of C++11 programming.

除了上面提到的基础库和高级编程环境外，这本书还依赖一个我们过去几年开发的相对小的高级Lib 库 vath, 以 C++ 类的方式封装底层基础库原语的高级易用的工具库. 我们起初的动机是可以简单的使用线程管理工具基于原生的基础库和一些简单的处理工具应付使用 OpenMP 不太容易处理的并行计算问题。这些附加的库可能在后续章节中讨论。在这里介绍一下 OpenMP 或 TBB 的可移植行：相同程序接口通过 Pthreads (对于 Linux /Unix 系统) 和在Windows 系统中的线程库实现以及使用 C++11 线程库实现的第三方库。这本书重点是使用这个库，不是讲具体实现这些库。然而由于教学的原因尽可能的采用最简单的编码规范在源代码中，方便对 Pthreads 或 Windows C++11 详细研究的读者查看

As far as the application examples are concerned, with the exception of a few cases in which our purpose is to show some specific feature of one of the basic libraries, we access Pthreads or Windows threads via portable code using the vath library. Most of the code examples have a vath version and an OpenMP version and, whenever relevant, a TBB version.

就应用实例而言，除了少数情况外，都是为了演示基础库的某个特性，我们通过 vath 库做 Pthreads 或 Windows 线程库的兼容工作，大部分实例都有对应的 vath 、OpenMP、TBB 的版本号做关联

## 本书的组织结构

Chapter 1 reviews the basic concepts and features of current computing platforms needed to set the <f>stage</f> for concurrent and parallel programming. Particular attention is paid to the impact of the multicore evolution of computing architectures, as well as other basic issues having an <f>impact</f> on <f>efficient</f> software development, such as the <f>hierarchical</f> memory organization, or the increased impact of rapidly evolving <f>heterogeneous</f> architectures <f>incorporating</f> specialized computing platforms like Intel Xeon Phi and GPU @@accelerators.

第一章回顾了当前计算平台下并发、并行程序所需的基础概念和特性. 尤其需要注意的计算架构多核演化带来的影响, 以及在开发高性能软件的一些其他问题，例如分层存储结构或迅速发展的异构架构体系纳入专门的计算平台（Intel Xeon Phi 和 GPU加速器）带来的影响。

Chapter 2 introduces a number of basic concepts and facts on multithreading processing that are totally generic and independent of the different programming environments. They summarize the very general features that determine the way multithreading is implemented in existing computing platforms.

第二章介绍了一些通用独立于不同的程序运行环境的多线程处理概念。总结了一些通用特性在现有计算平台中的实现方式.

Chapter 3 introduces threads in detail. First, the programming interfaces proposed by Pthreads, Windows, and C++11 to create and run a team of worker threads are discussed, with the help of specific examples. Then, a <f>portable</f> thread management utility from the vath library is introduced, <f>encapsulating</f> the basic programming interfaces. Finally, a first look at OpenMP is taken to show how the same thread management features are <f>declined</f> in this environment. A few examples introduce some basic multithreading issues, like thread safety or thread synchronization. This initial part of the book adopts the traditional thread-centric programming style in which the activity of each thread in the application is perfectly identified.

第三章详细的介绍线程. 首先介绍Pthreads、Windows 线程库、C++11线程库的编程接口，并举例说明。其次介绍一种轻量级的线程管理工具库，封装基础的线程库接口。最后， 展示 OpenMP 是如何方便实现和线程管理通用的特性的，一些例子介绍多线程的问题，比如线程安全和线程同步。该书前面部分采用传统的线程模式开发，在应用程序中每个激活的线程都是明确的标识的。

Chapter 4 <f>examines</f> the thread safety issue for function calls: under what conditions a library function provides the correct, expected service when asynchronously called by several threads in a multithreaded environment? Random number generators are used as examples of functions that are not thread-safe. A detailed discussion follows, <f>concerning</f> the thread-specific storage tools proposed by different programming environments (OpenMP, TBB, C++11, Windows) in order to enforce thread safety in functions that are not by nature thread-safe. Best practices concerning the thread-specific storage tools are discussed.

第四章探讨在函数调用时的线程安全问题: 在什么条件下一个 Lib 库的函数可正确运行当在多线程环境下被多个线程异步调用？其中随机生成一个数字的函数就是非线程安全的. 详细的讨论在不同的运行环境下线程特定存储工具使得原本非线程安全的函数转化为线程安全函数，讨论线程特定存储工具实现的最佳实践。

Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the fundamental issue of thread synchronization. Two basic thread synchronization primitives – mutual exclusion and event synchronization – are introduced. Mutual exclusion deals with thread safety in shared data accesses, and in its simplest forms this primitive is easy to use in application programming. Chapter 5 examines in detail the mutual exclusion interfaces available in the five programming environments, underlining the different additional features proposed by each one of them. Then, atomic operations are introduced as an efficient alternative to mutual exclusion in some specific cases, and the way they operate in OpenMP is reviewed (an in-depth discussion of atomic operations is reserved to Chapter 8). Finally, the concurrent container classes provided by TBB are described. They correspond to extensions of the Standard Template Library containers having internally built-in thread safety, not requiring explicit mutual exclusion in their data accesses. This chapter concludes with a number of observations concerning mutual exclusion pitfalls and best practices.

第五章和第六章讨论线程同步的基本问题。两个基本的线程同步方式 - 互斥和事件同步。互斥处理线程安全在共享访问数据问题, 该方式也是最简单原始的一种同步方式在应用程序中 . 第五章在五个开发环境中详细的探讨互斥接口，强调在每个环境中的附加特性。然后是介绍在某些情况下使用原子操作替代互斥锁，和 OpenMP 的使用方法(在第八章会深入的讨论原子操作)。 最后描述  TBB 的并发容器类，是和 STL 中的容器一一对应的线程安全容器，在访问它们的数据时不需要额外的互斥锁。这章总结并给出了关于互斥锁的一些陷阱和最佳实践的建议

Chapter 6 is concerned with event synchronization, namely, how to force a thread to wait for an event triggered by another thread (an event can be, for example, a change of value of some shared data item). A detailed pedagogical discussion of the event synchronization primitives in Pthreads, Windows, and C++11 is presented. However, direct use of these event synchronization primitives is indeed low-level programming, and they are never used as such in the rest of the book. They will show up encapsulated in higher level, easy-to-use vath utilities discussed in Chapter 9.

第六章主要介绍事件同步，换句话就是如何强制一个线程等待一个事件由另一个线程触发（例如一个事件可以是修改共享数据）。详细的介绍事件同步在 Pthreads、Windows、C++11 中的原语。然而在开发中直接用线程同步原语是低级的编程接口，在本书的后面将不会用到，它们将被封装成高级的、易使用的高级编程工具库，该库在第九章详细讨论

Chapter 7 focuses on the fundamental problem in shared memory programming: given the asynchronous behavior of threads and the hierarchical structure of the memory system, how can we know for sure that a shared data access retrieves the correct, expected data value? This problem leads to the notion of memory consistency model, and a simple, high-level discussion of the relevance of this concept is presented. This leads to the fundamental conclusion of this chapter: mutual exclusion, initially introduced to enforce thread safety in memory write operations, is also required to enforce memory consistency in memory read operations.

第七章重点讲在内存共享编程方面的基本问题：线程异步执行和内存分层结构，我们如何确认访问获取一个共享数据是正确的，是期望的值？这个问题引申出内存一致性模型概念，高级编程接口的相关概念。最终得出基本的结论：互斥线程同步使得内存写操作时强制线程安全,并且在内存读操作的时候强制内存的一致性

On the basis of the previous memory consistency concepts, Chapter 8 presents a rather detailed discussion of the powerful atomic classes proposed by C++11 and TBB, as well as the Windows atomic services. Besides the obvious use in replacing mutex locking, this chapter discusses the way they can be used to implement efficient, custom synchronization utilities. First, the discussion focuses on the way to enforce thread safety in shared data accesses, not using mutual exclusion: the so-called lock-free algorithms. Next, it is shown how the memory consistency constraints embedded in the atomic services are used to implement custom synchronization patterns based on “happens before” relations among operations in different threads. Two examples are proposed, implementing synchronization utilities incorporated in the vath library.

前面提到内存一致性的概念，第八章将更加详细的介绍 C++11 和 TBB 功能强大的原子类以及 Windows 的原子服务。除了可以明显替换互斥锁，这章还讨论如何实现高性能自定义同步工具。首先讨论在不适用互斥操作的情况下实现线程安全的访问共享数据：称为无锁算法。接着介绍用嵌入到原子操作服务中的内存一致性约束实现自定义同步模式在不同线程的操作的关系，两个例子举例说明在库中实现同步工具。

Chapter 9 presents an overview of high-level thread synchronization utilities incorporated in the vath library. They implement synchronization patterns common in applications programming (synchronized memory read-writes, Boolean locks, blocking barriers, reader-writer locks, concurrent queues) that are not immediately available in OpenMP. A pure OpenMP version of some these utilities is also provided. The discussion on the scope and impact of these utilities, as well as the examples proposed, is designed to significantly contribute to sharpen the understanding of thread synchronization pitfalls and best practices.

Chapters 10 and 11 are the core of this book: the presentation of the OpenMP and Intel TBB programming environments. The focus moves at this point to thread pool interfaces—the underlying architecture of both programming environments—where threads are created first and wait silently in a blocked state to be activated to execute a task. The traditional OpenMP programming model relies on a thread-centric pool, in the sense that there is a clear mapping between parallel tasks and threads, and it is possible to know at any time what every thread is doing. If more parallelism in needed in the applications, more threads are added to the pool. Nearly 10 years ago, an alternative programming model emerged, pioneered by Cilk [3], in which any number of parallel tasks are executed by a fixed number of threads, their execution being organized in an innovative way with a substantial amount of intelligence in the task scheduler itself. In such a task-centric environment, it is not possible to know what every individual thread is doing at a given time. TBB first implemented this model as a standalone library, and at about the same time OpenMP started to integrate task-centric software technologies in the 3.0 and 3.1 versions. The recent 4.0 version also makes a substantial step in this direction. Therefore, at this point readers are led to move progressively from thinking about threads to thinking about parallel tasks. The focus starts to move from thread centric to task-centric programming, particularly adapted to irregular, recursive, or unbalanced parallel contexts.

Chapter 10 presents a complete overview of OpenMP: the traditional programming model as well as a full discussion and examples of the new features incorporated in the latest OpenMP 4.0 release. Particular attention is given to the pitfalls and best practices related to the task directive. Besides the 4.0 extension of the task API incorporating a substantial number of additional task-centric features, the other major 4.0 extensions are also reviewed, like the cancellation of parallel constructs, thread affinity, and directives for vectorization and code offloading to external accelerators.

Chapter 11 concentrates on the TBB programming environment. TBB proposes a number of useful standalone utilities, already discussed in previous chapters. This chapter concentrates on the high-level TBB programming environment, based on a number of easy-to-use, STL like automatic parallelization algorithms that cope with a variety of different parallel patterns. Then, the discussion moves to a recent programming interface providing a simplified access to the most relevant features of the task scheduler, and several of the examples proposed in the OpenMP chapter are reexamined in this context. The discussion of the full task scheduler API is delayed to Chapter 16.

Chapter 12 discusses yet another thread management utilities: the SPool and NPool thread pool classes proposed by the vath library, implementing, respectively, a thread-centric or a task-centric programming environment. The SPool class has already been used to implement simple parallel patterns in previous chapters. Our motivation in developing these thread pools was not to compete with professional, well-established programming standards, but to benefit from some additional programming comfort in some specific cases not easily handled by OpenMP. Unlike OpenMP or TBB, thread pools are explicitly created by the user. An application can dispose of several independent pools, and parallel jobs can be submitted to all of them. Client threads that submit jobs are always external to the pools, but they are correctly synchronized with the jobs they submit. The task scheduler of the NPool utility is less refined than those implemented in OpenMP or TBB, but the pool can run most of the OpenMP or TBB examples proposed in the two previous chapters. These environment makes it very easy to run several parallel routines in parallel, and an explicit example of the added value they provide is presented at the end of the chapter.

The three following chapters discuss a few full applications taken from computational sciences, each one concentrating on one specific parallel context. The purpose here is to clearly understand the multithreaded architecture of the applications and the thread synchronization requirements that follow. We also look in detail at their scaling properties and at the impact on performance of excessive synchronization overhead. It is here that an example is met in which mediocre scaling properties are improved by the use of custom synchronization tools constructed with TBB or C++11 utilities. Chapter 13 discusses a molecular dynamics application—computing the trajectories of a set of interacting particles—exhibiting a substantial demand of barrier synchronization. Chapter 14 deals with data parallelism, developing two classical examples of domain decomposition in solving partial differential equations. Chapter 15 discusses pipelining, a kind of control parallelism totally different from data parallelism. Two complete pipelining applications are developed, one of them dealing with a image treatment problem. In all cases, vath, OpenMP and TBB versions of the code are proposed (which are sometimes very similar).

 The examples in Chapters 13–15 deal with simple but realistic scientific prob- lems. However, a significant pedagogical effort has been made to make them accessible to readers not having a scientific background. Simple descriptions are provided of the relevance and interest of the problem, but the discussion concentrates on the solutions to the programming challenges raised by the application.

Last but not least, Chapter 16 deals with the programming interfaces enabling direct access to the TBB task scheduler. This subject, admittedly a rather advanced subject on task parallelism, is nevertheless interesting and relevant. It was often emphasized in preceding chapters that the event synchronization primitives and high-level utilities discussed in Chapters 6 and 8 are not adapted to be used in task-centric environments (TBB, NPool, or the OpenMP task API), because they are programmed inside parallel tasks, but they really synchronize the underlying executing threads. This is fine as long as a controlled, one-to-one mapping of tasks to threads is established. However, in task-centric environments this issue is handled by introducing specific task synchronization features in the task scheduler itself, enabling programmers to synchronize tasks, not threads. Chapter 10 covers a OpenMP 4.0 extension, based on the new depends directive, that goes in this direction. The TBB task scheduler API implements task synchronization by using advanced scheduler features to organize the way the parallel tasks are scheduled and executed. In Chapter 16, a number of task synchronization examples are provided. In addition, the task scheduler is used to explore possible optimization strategies designed to improve the performance of the molecular dynamics application discussed in Chapter 13.

Finally, a few more words about support software, which can be downloaded from the book site http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780128037614. There are, in early chapters, some examples that target specific Pthreads, Windows, or C++11 features. But the majority of examples access the basic library utilities through the portable vath library presented in Chapters 9 and 12. The examples are therefore fully portable, and it is up to the reader to decide what implementation to use. Annex A provides a complete description of the @@accompanying@@ software, as well as detailed instructions for installation of the different software components, and for compilation and execution of the vath library and the code examples.

最后，说一下该书的软件支持，可以在该书的网站 http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780128037614 下载，在前面章节中一些实例演示关于 Pthreads、Windows 线程库或者 C++11 线程库的特性. 但大部分的实例是基于基础库实现的 vath Lib 库实现的，在第九章到第十二章。因此这些实例都是完全可移植的，并且读者可以决定哪些实现可以应用。附录中提供不同软件组件详细的安装实例，以及 vath Lib 库编译运行的例子。
